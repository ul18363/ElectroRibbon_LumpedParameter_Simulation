%% Local Strains
%  A positive l_strain at the position "i", means that the element to the
%  left of "i", got closer to "i", since we take that the direction to the
%  right is positive. (Thus it will tend to pushh the particle i to the
%  its relative right)
%  On the other hand a r_strain at the position "i", means that the element 
%  to the right of "i" got further to the right than its equilibrium
%  position. (Thus it will push it to its relative right)

l_deform_f = @(dp_v) [o -dp_v]-l_dp; % Calculates local deformation from particle to the left

%% Local Shear forces
% Two shear forces in place, the one exerted from the particle to the left,
% and another exerted from a particle to the right.

% relative direction of the bar at  particle "i"
%% Shear Force from "i" to "i+1"

% Claims:
%   1- The edges don't have a shear force. (P0 and P6)
%   2- The "resting" direction of the beam  between "i" and "i+1" is the
%   same as the one between "i-1" and "i" and is referred as x_rel[i]
%   3- The perpendicular direction to x_rel[i] (90 deg, anticlockwise) is
%   y_rel. and can be computed as R*x_rel. (same as dp_per.)
%   4- The Shear Force is proportional to the displacement of "i+1" 
%   with respect of the line formed by "i-1" and "i". This displacement is
%   called dy_rel. And can be calculated by obtaining the component of dp[i]
%   on the y_rel[i]
%   5- F_shear= G*A*dy/l
%   
% Boundary Conditions:
%     Free Rotation:
%          The edges (P0 & P6) don't have Shear Force.
%          The edges (P0 & P6) don't excert Shear force over P1 and P5
%          (that's because the virtual extra edges x_r0 and x_rend are not
%          defined)
%     Fixed Rotation:  
%           The edges (P0 & P6) excert Shear force over P1 and P5
%          (that's because the virtual extra edges x_r0 and x_rend are not
