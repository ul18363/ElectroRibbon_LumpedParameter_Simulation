The previous model considered the transversal/shear coefficients between two particles the same, regardless if it was "left to right"/i->ii 
or "right to left"/ii->i.

An observation from this model is that there is no positive (stable) set of elastic coefficients that can satisfy the force equations.

An argument is that the shear coefficient may vary with the angle of the geometry. That possibility is the one that is pursued in this try.
